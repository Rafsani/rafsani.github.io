abstract: Deep learning methods showed promise for classifying headache disorders and extracting biomarkers from MRI data. Pre-trained models perform better for specialized tasks when Bne-tuned on small, domain-speciBc datasets. Our model is Bne-tuned on a pre-trained model to optimize headache classiBcation and biomarker extraction.
